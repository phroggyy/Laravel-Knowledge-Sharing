# Laravel Knowledge Sharing

Laravel Knowledge Sharing is a Laravel application which allows users to share links with a title and description. The application was developed for a session of the [European Youth Parliament (EYP)](http://eyp.org). More information about the session itself can be found at [Amsterdam2015](http://amsterdam2015.eu).

## Installation

To install the application, configure your database settings in a .env environment file (you can use the provided .env.example for a template), and set up the correct database type in config/database.php. Once done, upload the app and run the migrations to create the database tables and relations. Note that the database seed is optional and is simply the one used for the EYP session.
